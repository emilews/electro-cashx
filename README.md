# Electro CashX: Wallet & DEX!
A BCH wallet for desktop with SLP support.

# Plan
## Milestones

This is based on milestones, which are going to be publicly posted wherever I can (reddit, a public trello board, the repo, etc.). I want this to be as transparent as possible.
The planned milestones are as follows:

### Wallet

- Import/export seeds.
- First for BCH only.
- Then SLP support.
- Optional Tor (or similar) support.
### Price Node
- Optional Tor (or similar) support.
- Can interconnect traders for, well, trading.
- Can deliver price info on any currency.
- Can deliver details of trading volumes and prices for each market pair.
- Can handle disputes in buy/sell operations between traders,
### DEX
- BCH based price for other crypto.
- Multi currency and crypto support.
- Multi payment gateways support.
- Trade volumes shown for different markets.
- What do you mean 'KYC'? Nah, that shit's for gov losers.
